Last June, a protest movement led by first-time activists from Generation Z emerged in response to the government\u2019s Finance Bill, which would have introduced sweeping tax increases. The government quickly withdrew its plans, but protests continued, articulating anger at economic strife, elite corruption and <a href=\"https://lens.civicus.org/interview/the-protests-mark-the-beginning-of-a-new-era-in-which-kenyans-refuse-to-remain-silent/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">out-of-touch politicians</a>. The government\u2019s response has been violent. Police have used batons, teargas and water cannon against protesters. On the worst day of violence, 25 June, when some protesters attempted to storm parliament, police fired live ammunition. <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240924-amnesty-calls-for-commission-to-probe-kenya-protest-deaths\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Over 60 people</a> were reported killed during the protests.
