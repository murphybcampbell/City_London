A third of them passed through the Hotel Lutetia in Paris, a luxury hotel that was requisitioned by the French state to host the former prisoners.\u00a0Many families went to the Lutetia, desperately hoping to find out if their loved ones had returned. FRANCE 24's St\u00e9phanie Trouillard and Claire Paccalin spoke to survivors of the camps who passed through the hotel, as well as the daughter of a man who perished in Auschwitz-Birkenau.",

The incredible story went largely unrecognised for years until a 1980s British television programme, \"That's Life\", managed to find an entire audience of people whose lives had been saved thanks to Winton, who was surprised to discover that every single other person there owed their lives to him. His incredible story was recently told in the film \"One Life\". His son Nick Winton spoke to us in Perspective.",

The government quickly withdrew its plans, but protests continued, articulating anger at economic strife, elite corruption and <a href=\"https://lens.civicus.org/interview/the-protests-mark-the-beginning-of-a-new-era-in-which-kenyans-refuse-to-remain-silent/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">out-of-touch politicians</a>.

On the worst day of violence, 25 June, when some protesters attempted to storm parliament, police fired live ammunition. <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20240924-amnesty-calls-for-commission-to-probe-kenya-protest-deaths\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Over 60 people</a> were reported killed during the protests.
